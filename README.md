# preface
* reading/writing fields and invoking methods/constructors
rise issues of access control
* for example, if you declare a field as private it should
  be accessible only in the class
* access control rules can be suppressed when we 
are using reflection
* **deep reflection** - accessing "inaccessible" members using
reflection
* used by Hibernate and Spring
* before `JDK9`: call `setAccessible(true)` on 
`Field`/`Method`/`Constructor`
* we will show how to handle deep reflection on the `JDK11`
